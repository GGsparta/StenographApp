# StenographApp
A stenography application developped for a university project developped by:
- Ambre Donnadieu
- Yoann Haffner
- Simon Lauzeral

# Known issues
- The application refuses permissions on OnePlus 6
- 3 times during the project, the text decoded was slighty different than the one encoded. It couldn't be reproduced consistently.
- Emojis break the encoding process (not critical)
